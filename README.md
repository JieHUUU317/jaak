Jaak Environment Model
======================

Jaak is an agent environment that runs on the synchronous engine of Janus. It provides a discrete 2D environment model and a simplified agent-environment interaction model based on LOGO-like primitives. Its purpose is similar to NetLogo, StarLogo, and TurtleKit. Jaak also provides the definition of capacities for using Jaak from agents developed in SARL.

Jaak relies on a logo-based simulation model. Unlike StarLogo or NetLogo, Jaak proposes a Logo programming approach while giving all the possibilities afforded by high level programming languages such as Java.

Jaak lets students open simulations and "play" with them, exploring their behavior under various conditions. It is also an authoring environment which enables students, teachers, and junior and senior developers to create their own models.
